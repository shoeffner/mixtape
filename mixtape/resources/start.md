Hello {.username}\!

I am @shoeffner's [Mixtape](https://github.com/shoeffner/mixtape) :\)

You can send me commands such as
`/play Panic\! At the Disco - Mona Lisa`

My inline friends, for example @music and @youtube, can make this easier, just ask them for you songs and send me the results\!
/friends lists more friends of mine :\)

And if you want to share your own composition with me, you can drop me an mp3 \(up to 20MB\)\.

If you need help, type /help\.

Happy mixing\!
